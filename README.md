# Practice

Various sorting algorithms that I spent the last 6 hours learning.
Can I write these from scratch now? Probably not, but I'm no genius, I don't have an eidetic memory or anything
it's gonna take some time man!

* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Selection Sort (pseudo code)
* Bubble Sort (pseudo code)
* default python sort
* Comb Sort (pseudo code)

Code for the sorting algorithms has comments with pseudo code for understanding how the algo's work.

* ```selsort.py``` are the algorithms
* ```sorting.py``` is for running the algo's
* ```helper_decorators.py``` is the timing decorator.
